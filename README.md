# Covid Passport

The world is confronting a serious pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and there is a need for a lot of
digital improvements so the people of every country can live their lives in the most
comfortable way despite the restrictions.
In the middle of 2021 the European Union started working on “Digital Covid Certificate”,
which would let the citizens of the EU to travel in the EU region by owning the mentioned
certificate. It could have been achieved by being vaccinated against COVID-19, receiving a
negative test result or by recovering from COVID-19.
The Covid Passport is a concept application to help the governments open their borders for
citizens. Its key feature is its secure, multi-layer certificate validation process, which involves a
decentralized blockchain validation step too. The application can validate any type of
vaccination certificate, Covid test result or evidence of recovery from COVID-19. After a
certificate validation, the checking process is very simple, because it uses QR exchange
between the citizen and the authority personnel. Its main goal is to be used at border checks,
but another use case could be filtering the people at festival, club, event or local entrances.
